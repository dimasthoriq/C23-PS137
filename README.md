# MinSatu

MinSatu is an Android application designed to facilitate users in exploring various activities to engage in. This application utilizes machine learning and a TensorFlow recommendation system deployed on Google Cloud to provide activity recommendations in line with user preferences. Designed with Material Design principles and built using up-to-date Android technologies like Jetpack Compose, Kotlin, and Retrofit, MinSatu offers a modern and seamless user experience.

## Features

### User Authentication
The application provides user registration and login features, allowing users to create an account and log into the system.

### Activity Recommendation System
Using a machine-learning-based recommendation system, the application provides activity recommendations based on user preferences. Each activity comes with details such as description, location, and start and end times.

### Profile Management
Users can manage their profiles, which include details like name, email, and activity preferences.

### Quick Survey
This feature allows the application to gather user preferences through a series of quick questions. The results are used to provide more relevant activity recommendations.
